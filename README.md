# Code Refactor for Accessability and Search Engine Opitimization

## Description 
I wanted to refactor a website's code in order to make it more accessable for people with impairments that might be using a screen reader, for example. I wanted to do this because everyone should be able to enjoy the same website! I did this by adding semantic mark-ups instead of creating "div soup".
